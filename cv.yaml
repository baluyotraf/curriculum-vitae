projects:
  - title: Rock Size Distribution
    description: >-
      A project for a startup company to utilize computer vision in computing
      the rock size distribution during the mining process. While sieving the
      rocks is considered a more accurate approach to determine the rock size,
      however it is not scalable for large mining operations. The project used
      edge detection neural networks to segment and calculate the distribution
      of rock particles.
