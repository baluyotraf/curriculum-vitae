projects:
  - title: Rock Size Distribution
    description: >-
      A commission project to demonstrate the calculation of the rock sizes
      during the mining process. Sieving the rocks is considered a more
      accurate approach to determine the rock size, however it is not scalable
      for large mining operations. The idea is to present a possible
      alternative using computer vision.
