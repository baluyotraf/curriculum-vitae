projects:
  - title: Rock Size Distribution
    description: >-
      A project for a startup company to utilize computer vision in computing
      the rock size distribution during the mining process. While sieving the
      rocks is considered a more accurate approach to determine the rock size,
      however it is not scalable for large mining operations. The project used
      edge detection neural networks to segment and calculate the distribution
      of rock particles.

  - title: Mine Worker Detection
    description: >-
      A project for a startup company to see if identifying people inside the
      mines are feasible using RBG cameras. An SSD network using a Mobilenet
      as a base model was trained. The model was pretrained using the COCO
      dataset and additional images of people in dark areas were used as the
      training set to simulate mine lighting environments.

  - title: Rice Health Classifier
    description: >-
      A project for a research team looking at drones to improve rice farming
      processes. For this project, the feasibility of identifying healthy and
      unhealthy rice fields using drone images was tested. A convolutional
      neural network based on VGG16 was trained. The model was pretrained with
      Imagenet and trained with rice drone images.

  - title: Sandpaper Granularity
    description: >-
      A project for a sandpaper manufacturing company to test if computer
      vision can be used to determine the smoothness of the sand paper. The
      project used image segmentation and shape characteristics in order to
      determine the rough sand. From the rough sand, the area covered by the
      rough sand is calculated and correlated with the sand paper quality.
